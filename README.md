# MSA-UNet3+
MSA-UNet3+: Advanced Coronary DSA Segmentation Framework
MSA-UNet3+ is a novel deep learning architecture for coronary artery segmentation in Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images, designed to overcome key challenges like low contrast, noise, and anatomical complexity.

The framework builds upon a hierarchical U-Net3+ backbone enhanced with three core innovations: (1) a Multi-Scale Dilated Bottleneck that captures vessel features at varying receptive fields using parallel dilated convolutions, (2) a Contextual Attention Fusion Module that dynamically weights spatial and channel features through squeeze-excitation blocks, and (3) a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Loss that optimizes feature space geometry for class-imbalanced data. 

The architecture uniquely preserves fine vessel details through multi-level skip connections while maintaining computational efficiency via bottleneck distillation. Future versions will address current limitations in noisy imaging conditions through IVUS/OCT fusion and edge-device optimization.
